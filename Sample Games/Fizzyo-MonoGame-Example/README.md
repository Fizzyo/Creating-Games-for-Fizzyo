# Thanks for helping the Microsoft Fizzyo Challenge
----

Our hope is the Fizzyo device this will motivate children to do their physio every day and potentially help other families with Cystic Fibrosis as well!

If you are a game developer it’s as easy as 1-2-3.

The Fizzyo device appears as a Joystick on the computer, so you simply need to have your game interpret joystick inputs.

----
## We allow for 2 types of inputs:

 - Breath – This appears as the Horizontal axis of the joystick, (float) returns breath strength from (-1 – 1) with 0 being not breathing, > 0.7 blowing or breathing out hard and < -0.5 breathing in hard
 
 - Button Press – We’ve added 1 button to the device to make game interactions a little more sophisticated. This button appears as Fire1 from a joystick control.

----
## MonoGame sample details:
The Monogame sample is comprised of two projects:

### Fizzyo library project
Contains all the Fizzyo components, scripts and project/game helpers, including:

- FizzyoDevice - main Fizzyo device component exposing the Breath output and the device button.
- BreathRecogniser - helper class to examine the Fizzyo device output with details / analysis of each breath
- InputState - A generic input helper used by the Fizzyo classes but also available for games as well.

### MonoGame Sample
A simple 3D game where the player controls a ship responsible for collecting Fuel Cells in a factory.  In this the player must charge up the ships energy using their breath and then control the ship to wander the map.
> Sample sourced from the orignal XNA FuelCell Sample [found here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd940288.aspx)

samples is broken down in to three main classes:

- GameObjects - all the component classes used within the project, from Ground, ships, obsticles, etc
- GameConstants - all the hard coded settings used by the project to control the view, lives, 3D view, etc
- Game1 - the main game code for updating and drawing the game

Please refer to the [original sample source](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd940288.aspx) for queries on the inner workings of the sample.
The modifications made to adapt the Fizzyo device include:

* Added InputState / FizzyoDevice classes as [GameServices](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.gameservicecontainer.aspx) so they are easily referenced throughout the solution.
* Added an EngineCharge UI element to show how much energy the ship has, charged using the output from the Fizzyo Device pressure
* Updated the FuelCarrier input handling so that it only moves when the player is not doing a breath and that movement depletes the ships charge. (also updated to use the InputState library)

----
## Fizzyo device use with MonoGame

Grab the Fizzyo library from the sample and add it to your project as follows:

1.  Initialise the InputState class:

```
var inputState = new InputState(this);
Services.AddService(typeof(InputState), inputState);
```

> Note, the InputState object needs updating in the main game loop each update.

2. Initialise the FizzyoDevice class:

```
var fizzyo = new FizzyoDevice(this);
fizzyo.useRecordedData = true; // Change this value to use actual values instead of recorded data
Services.AddService(typeof(FizzyoDevice), fizzyo);
```
> Note, the FizzyoDevice object needs updating in the main game loop each update.

3. To consume the Fizzyo device from other classes / objects, simply use the Game Service retrieval logic.

```
var fizzyoDevice = (FizzyoDevice)game.Services.GetService(typeof(FizzyoDevice));
```

4. poll the fizzyo device for breath / button data each update

```
//(bool) Will return if the Fizzyo Device button is pressed or not.
bool buttonPresed = FizzyoDevice.ButtonDown(); 
//(float) returns breath strength from (-1 – 1) with 0 being not breathing, **> 0.7** blowing or breathing out hard and **< -0.5** breathing in hard
float pressure = FizzyoDevice.Pressure();
```

> Alternatively you can just bypass the Fizzyo logic and call the device inputs directly using:
> ```
> //Get the button input direct from the gamePad:
> bool buttonPresed = Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.A);
> //Get the pressure input direct from the gamePad:
> float pressure = GamePad.GetState(0).ThumbSticks.Left.X;
> ```

----
## New BreathRecogniser control:
To help with detecting breath lengths / pressure and whether the player is blowing in to the Fizzyo device, a helper class has been provided.
Breath Analyser class decouples the logic of recognizing breaths from a stream of pressure samples from acting on the recognition.

To use:

1. Create an instance of BreathAnalyser, passing in the calibration values for MaxPressure and MaxBreathLength: 
```
    BreathAnalyser breathAnalyser = new BreathAnalyser(MaxPressure, MaxBreathLength);
```
2. Register for the ExhalationCompleteEvent: 
```
    breathAnalyser.ExhalationComplete += ExhalationCompleteHandler;
```
3. Add pressure samples in the update loop: 
```
    AddSample(Time.DeltaTime, pressure);
```
4. The event will fire at the end of an exhaled breath and provide information for:
    
       a) BreathLength
       b) BreathCount
       c) ExhaledVolume
       d) IsBreathGood
    
5. You can interrogate the breath analyser at any time to determine:
    
       a) BreathLength
       b) BreathCount
       c) ExhaledVolume
       d) IsExhaling
       e) MaxPressure
       f) MaxBreathLength
    
The algorithm for determining whether a breath is good or not is encapsulated in the method:
``` 
IsBreathGood()
```
This currently returns true if the average breath pressure and breath length is within 80% of the max.

----
## Typical Physio Sequence
- 9 - 10 cycles of the following routine
- Long slow breadth in until lungs are full (typically 2 sec depending on size of child)
- Hold the breadth 
- Exhale out active but not forced (typically 3 secs in length maintained velocity) 
- Then a huff/cough (the device is typically removed) This is forceful and the most important as its part of airway clearance (can this be used with your game)

----
## Game Types - think about the exercise

### Games children have suggested
- Bowling/firing a object (Breadth to charge)
- Geometry Dash/Flappy Bird (Jumping or movement)
- Angry Bird (Breadth to charge/fire)

----
## Game requirements

Keep in mind that we don’t want to force the children to blow to a certain pressure or for a certain amount of time. This is really up to the individual doing the exercises, we just want to detect a blow.

Designing a game for these limited interactions can be challenging! A good play pattern has been to use the blow to propel the character forward (at a constant speed) and the button to jump or fire a weapon.

In relation to output of the games from Health Hack we would like to implement a specific requirement / specification of games for use with the Fizzyo devices.

## Hardware and test data being provided

### Airway Clearance Physio Devices

![Airway Clearance Devices](https://github.com/Fizzyo/fizzyo.github.io/raw/master/Images/Airway.jpg)


- We will be making available 3 x Fizzyo PEP Engineering devices to hacker for testing of game content

- We will be making available 3 x Fizzyo Acepella Engineering devices to hacker for testing of game content

### Test Data from devices + Samples

- We have provided a MonoGame Sample Game which shows the input methods - see [Fizzyo-Monogame-Example](https://github.com/ichealthhack/fizzyo-challenge/tree/master/Fizzyo-MonoGame-Example) Folder which contains pre calibration information, a sample game and test harness + test data
The MonoGame Project provides the FizzyoDevice classes in a separate PCL project, for easy use in your game together with a handy InputManagement system and the BreathAnalyser helper.

- We have provided Test Harnesses and sample data. The data data set of captured results from the devices are for games testing. This includes an example that allows you to load and playback breath data saved from a fizzyo device.

> Note, when adding the test data to your project, be sure to set the files to "Copy Always" in the Build opions on the properties pane, else they will not load.

## How the Devices are used by Patients and how this should be related to game play

- Although getting a decent sized breath during inspiration is important – most of the focus is on expiration (this is the part where airway clearance is most effective).

- Inspiration is ‘free’ and un-resisted in all three techniques – while all 3 devices provide resistance against expiratory airflow 
(providing ‘positive expiratory pressure’ or PEP)

- PEP provides a consistent and measureable resistance against expiration

- Acapella and Flutter provide oscillatory resistance (Acapella with a magnetic lever and Flutter with a ball valve)

- Children aim for ‘active’ expiration rather than ‘relaxed or elastic recoil’ expiration(which is what happens normally). This means consistent, steady flow at a higher velocity than usual but not forced breathing.  

- Children aim for prolonged steady expiratory flow of at least 3s (although this may be a bit shorter in small children or those with severe disease who are breathless)

- The resistance in mid expiration for PEP should be 10-20cm H2O (ideally 12-15) measured by PEP manometer (in circuit) for mid-part of expiration.

----
## Physio Routine for children

![Physio Routine](https://github.com/Fizzyo/fizzyo.github.io/raw/master/Images/Routine.jpg)

- Treatments usually consistent of a series of ‘cycles’ – One cycle might typically include say 8-10 breaths through device (PEP & Acapella & Flutter ) as described above, followed by fewer but more forceful huffs (often not through the device- although some will huff through their PEP) and coughing as needed. The cycles are repeated until the chest feels clear. 

- Typical sessions should last no longer than 20 minutes.

- There needs to be a threshold for effort for an active blow (so that it doesn’t just respond to normal passive expiration) 

- It is important that we don’t incentivise more effort but do motivate for a longer blow, eg. acceleration could increase the longer the blow but definitely not accelerate with increased effort beyond the threshold trigger point.

## Game Deliverables

- All output will be under GNU open-source licensing and all entries stored within [this organisation](https://github.com/Fizzyo).

- All games should be ideally developed to become cross platform iOS, Android, Windows 10 and Windows Desktop the input for the game will use Phyiso equipment specially PEP and Acapella devices.

- Games are intended for an age range of 4 – 18 year olds

- Games should ideally include a competitive element so multiple or compete based games

- Games should ideally include a leaderboard service to allow children to compete

- Games can have a chat aspect but ideally this should be done within controlled gaming environments such as google play, Xbox live or Apple Game Center to ensure privacy.

- Microsoft Azure Cloud services can be provided to all projects to add cloud need services to the games.
