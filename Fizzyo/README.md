# Thanks for helping the Microsoft Fizzyo Challenge

***

Our hope is the Fizzyo device this will motivate children to do their physio every day and potentially help other families with Cystic Fibrosis as well!

If you are a game developer itâ€™s as easy as 1-2-3.

The Fizzyo device appears as a Joystick on the computer, so you simply need to have your game interpret joystick inputs.

## Available Frameworks

We currently provide two frameworks for use in building games for the Fizzyo pressure detection device:

The preferred method is using Unity3d

* ## [Unity](https://github.com/Fizzyo/FizzyoFramework-Unity)

Monogame is minimally supported

* ## [MonoGame](https://github.com/fizzyo/games/tree/master/Fizzyo/Fizzyo-MonoGame)

Full instructions are included for each engine / framework use of the components

***

## Contributions

If you have another framework / engine in mind that the current classes do not cover, then by all means submit a PR to this project (using the same style) for the new platform

***

## Active Development

The framework is still under development and we may periodically add new features, analysers or even device inputs to the framework. So check back often.
